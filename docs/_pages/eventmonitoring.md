Fluent Assertions has a set of extensions that allow you to verify that an object raised a particular event.
Before you can invoke the assertion extensions, you must first tell Fluent Assertions that you want to monitor the object:

```csharp
var subject = new EditCustomerViewModel();
using (var monitoredSubject = subject.Monitor())
{
    subject.Foo();
    monitoredSubject.Should().Raise("NameChangedEvent");
}
```

Notice that Fluent Assertions will keep monitoring the `subject` for as long as the `using` block lasts.

Assuming that weâ€™re dealing with a MVVM implementation, you might want to verify that it raised its `PropertyChanged` event for a particular property:

```csharp
monitoredSubject
  .Should().Raise("PropertyChanged")
  .WithSender(subject)
  .WithArgs<PropertyChangedEventArgs>(args => args.PropertyName == "SomeProperty");
```

Notice that `WithSender()` verifies that all occurrences had its sender argument set to the specified object.
`WithArgs()` just verifies that at least one occurrence had a matching `EventArgs` object.
In other words, event monitoring only works for events that comply with the standard two-argument sender/args .NET pattern.

Since verifying for `PropertyChanged` events is so common, we've included a specialized shortcut to the example above:

```csharp
subject.Should().Raise().PropertyChangeFor(x => x.SomeProperty);
```

You can also do the opposite; asserting that a particular event was not raised.

```csharp
subject.Should().NotRaisePropertyChangeFor(x => x.SomeProperty);
```

Or...

```csharp
subject.Should().NotRaise("SomeOtherEvent");
```

There's also a generic version of `Monitor()`.
It is used to limit which events you want to listen to.
You do that by providing a type which defines the events.

```csharp
var subject = new ClassWithManyEvents();
using (var monitor = subject.Monitor<IInterfaceWithFewEvents>();
{
    
}
```

This generic version of `Monitor()` is also very useful if you wish to monitor events of a dynamically generated class using `System.Reflection.Emit`.
Since events are dynamically generated and are not present in parent class non-generic version of `Monitor()` will not find the events.
This way you can tell the event monitor which interface was implemented in the generated class.

```csharp
POCOClass subject = EmitViewModelFromPOCOClass();

using (var monitor = subject.Monitor<ISomeInterface>())
{
    // POCO class doesn't have INotifyPropertyChanged implemented
    monitor.Should().Raise("SomeEvent");
}
```

The object returned by `Monitor` exposes a method named `GetEventRecorder` as well as the properties `MonitoredEvents` and `OccurredEvents` that you can use to directly interact with the monitor, e.g. to create your own extensions. For example:

```csharp
    var eventSource = new ClassThatRaisesEventsItself();
    using (var monitor = eventSource.Monitor<IEventRaisingInterface>())
    {
        EventMetadata[] metadata = monitor.MonitoredEvents;

        metadata.Should().BeEquivalentTo(new[]
        {
            new
            {
                EventName = nameof(IEventRaisingInterface.InterfaceEvent),
                HandlerType = typeof(EventHandler)
            }
        });
    }
```
